## Description
Scribe is a note taking applicaiton built on Express. The purpose of this application was to demonstrate routing in order to load, save, and delete notes. By utilizing the fetch API with different methods, we are able to perform the correct function on notes within the application.

This application was meant to satisfy the following user story:

```md

WHEN I choose to view all departments

WHEN I choose to view all roles
✅ THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
✅ THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
